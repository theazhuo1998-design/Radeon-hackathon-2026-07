## Benchmark evidence

Committed under the project root `benchmarks/` directory (paths relative to `submissions/track2-privateplate/`):

| Evidence | Directory |
| --- | --- |
| Sealed 21-case diagnostic re-run | [`../../benchmarks/c0/stage-b/sealed-suite-diag-16k-20260804T161006Z-brfix/`](../../benchmarks/c0/stage-b/sealed-suite-diag-16k-20260804T161006Z-brfix/) |
| Prefix-caching A/B | [`../../benchmarks/prefix-caching-ab-retry-20260803T071404Z/results/`](../../benchmarks/prefix-caching-ab-retry-20260803T071404Z/results/) |
| Trusted terminal presenter A/B | [`../../benchmarks/terminal-finalization-ab-20260803T094112Z-05/results/`](../../benchmarks/terminal-finalization-ab-20260803T094112Z-05/results/) |

Per-case SQLite databases are omitted by gitignore. Numerical results are project-recorded measurements within the documented experimental scope, not an official Track 2 leaderboard score.

## How to reproduce

From a clone of this contest repository:

```bash
cd submissions/track2-privateplate
npm install
```

Then follow the environment variables and `npm run dev:server` / `npm run dev:web` steps in the [project root README](../../README.md). Offline checks: `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test:eval-v2`. A full Radeon-backed run also requires the pinned local vLLM chat and embedding servers described in the Radeon adaptation document.
